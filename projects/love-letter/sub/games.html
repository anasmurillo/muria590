<div><p>When my mom didnt let me use the computer I would sneak to the computer room
anyone and play games, however, without her password I could only play solitaire and
the pinball games of which I wasnt sure of the rules or the goal of the game.
It was fun either way seeing things moving on the screen, it looked like on of the futuristic
cartoons that we watched on VHS films.
When my mom typed in her password however, It was a whole new gaming world for me.
I remember logging into disneychanel.com and cartoonnetwork.com to play the
games of some of the characters that I saw on TV. I would also log into Miniclip
and club penguin. My cousins would always be jealous of me because my mom would give me
30 minutes or so more to play. </p>
