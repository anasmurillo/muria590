<div><p>My very first memory of the internet is using it as a searching tool for homework.
 I rememner that my teacher asked our parents to help us do reasearch on fables.
 At the moment we were studying fables and compilations. My mom helped me do my reasearch and I can still remember
 parts of the fables. I chose mostly Aesop Fables, like the one of the turtle and the hare,
 and the one of the lion and the mouse. I think that the thing that I remember the most about
 this assignment was thinking about the enormity of the internet, and how all the information
 about everything was at the tips of my fingers; of course everything was password-proected
 by mom, but even like that.. </p>
