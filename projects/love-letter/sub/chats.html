<div><p>When I think of my first memories on the computer I immediately think
about MSN MESSENGER LIVE. The memories of the chats with my friends come to mind,
my mom would not let me know the computer's password, so I would only be able to chat
while she was at home, but she did not know that my older brother knew her very precious
password, and that he would let me use it for a while as long as I did not tell
our mom. It was one of those secrets that siblings keep. We would hide it from my sister
as well, because she would love getting us into trouble. So my experience with messenger
was more of an adventure (for every time that I logged in, my brother and me would be
looking over our shoulders to make sure our mom or my sister did not catch us by surprise.)
