      <h1>Mal Agueros
      By Nick Carbo</h1>
      <div class="caja"><p class="uno">If you come to Mojacar</p>
      <p class="uno">and peel open an orange full of worms,</p>
      <p class="uno">count how many there are because</p>
      <p class="uno">those are the days it will take for your body</p>
      <p class="uno">to decompose after you are buried.</p></div>

      <div class="cajas"><p class="dos">If you come to Mojacar</p>
      <p class="dos">and find a small green snake with its back</p>
      <p class="dos">broken, don't step on it or you'll cause</p>
      <p class="dos">an earthquake that will catch up to you</p>
      <p class="dos">while you sleep in a continent far, far away.</p></div>

      <div class="caja"> <p class="uno">If you come to Mojacar</p>
      <p class="uno">and two brown long-legged spiders crawl</p>
      <p class="uno">on your face and shoulders, keep a sharp eye</p>
      <p class="uno">out for two individuals, a mother-son, or</p>
      <p class="uno">sister-sister who will try to take your money.</p></div>

      <div class="cajas"> <p class="dos">If you come to Mojacar</p>
      <p class="dos">and see a scorpion scurry by your feet,</p>
      <p class="dos">note the direction it ran to, north, south,</p>
      <p class="dos">east, or west. You must avoid going there</p>
      <p class="dos">or risk the sting of losing a loved one.</p></div>

      <div class="caja"><p class="uno">If you come to Mojacar</p>
      <p class="uno">and a cock crows ten times at three</p>
      <p class="uno">in the morning, lock your door and all</p>
     <p class="uno"> the wooden windows because nightmares in silver</p>
      <p class="uno">dresses will arrive to slip into your bed.</p></div>
